#### NoClassDefFoundError & ClassNotFoundException

- Error 是编译器存在，运行时没了
  - 没有权限
  - 没有加载进classpath中
- Exception常见于 Class.forName();找不到对应的类

```text
ClassNotFoundException is an exception that occurs when you try to load a class at run time using Class.forName() or loadClass() methods and mentioned classes are not found in the classpath. NoClassDefFoundError is an error that occurs when a particular class is present at compile time, but was missing at run time.
```



Error 和Exception都是Throwable的子类，只要Throwable的子类才能被throw和catch；
